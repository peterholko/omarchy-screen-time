"""A clock that only moves forward.

Setting the system clock back is the first trick anyone tries, so nothing here
trusts the wall clock on its own. CLOCK_BOOTTIME is the reference because it
keeps counting across a suspend, where CLOCK_MONOTONIC does not. The wall clock
is only allowed to nudge the logical time by TOLERANCE per tick; anything wider
is recorded and ignored.
